        ```
        myLana = pylana.LanaAPI("Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9", "https://cloud.lanalabs.com/")
        ```
        
        ## Upload an Event Log without case attributes
        
        ```
        myLana.uploadEventLog(logFile, logSemantics)
        ```
        
        ## Upload an Event Log with case attributes
        
        ```
        myLana.uploadEventLogWithCaseAttributes(logFile, logSemantics, 
            caseAttributeFile, caseAttributeSemantics)
        ```
        
        ## Get User Logs

        ```
        myLana.chooseLog(logName)
        ```
        
        ## Append Events
        
        ```
        myLana.appendEvents(logId, logFile, logSemantics)
        ```
        
        ## Append Attributes
        
        ```
        myLana.appendAttributes(logId, caseAttributeFile, caseAttributeSemantics)
